# harfbuzzjs
Providing [HarfBuzz](https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz) shaping
library for client/server side JavaScript projects.

See the demo [here](https://harfbuzz.github.io/harfbuzzjs/).

## Building
1. Install emscripten
2. `./build.sh`

## Download
Download from the [releases tab](https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzzjs/releases).

## Usage and testing

### TL;DR

```javascript
hb = require("hbjs.js")
WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(fetch("hb.wasm")).then(function (result) {
  fetch('myfont.ttf').then(function (data) {
    return data.arrayBuffer();
  }).then(function (fontdata) {
    var blob = hb.createBlob(fontdata); // Load the font data into something Harfbuzz can use
    var face = hb.createFace(blob, 0);  // Select the first font in the file (there's normally only one!)
    var font = hb.createFont(face);     // Create a Harfbuzz font object from the face
    var buffer = hb.createBuffer();     // Make a buffer to hold some text
    buffer.addText('abc');              // Fill it with some stuff
    buffer.guessSegmentProperties();    // Set script, language and direction
    hb.shape(font, buffer);             // Shape the text, determining glyph IDs and positions
    var output = buffer.json();

    // Enumerate the glyphs
    var xCursor = 0;
    var yCursor = 0;
    for (glyph of output) {
        var glyphId = glyph.g;
        var xAdvance = glyph.ax;
        var xDisplacement = glyph.dx;
        var yDisplacement = glyph.dy;

        var svgPath = font.glyphToPath(glyphId);
        // You need to supply this bit
        drawAGlyph(svgPath, xCursor + xDisplacement, yDisplacement);

        xCursor += xAdvance;
    }

    // Release memory
    buffer.destroy();
    font.destroy();
    face.destroy();
    blob.destroy();
  })
})
```

More examples:

### Browser

1. `npx pad.js`
2. Open `http://127.0.0.1/examples/hbjs.example.html` or `http://127.0.0.1/examples/nohbjs.html`

### Node.js

1. `(cd examples && node hbjs.example.node.js)`

We provide a tiny wrapper (`hbjs.js`) around the main functionality of harfbuzz, but it's also easy to use other parts. (See `example/nohbjs.js` as an example. However, you may need a custom build to expose additional functionality.)

## [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/harfbuzzjs)
Can be added with `npm i harfbuzzjs` or `yarn add harfbuzzjs`, see the examples for
how to use it.

## Need more of the library?

harfbuzzjs uses a stripped-down version of Harfbuzz generated by compiling Harfbuzz with `-DHB_TINY`. This may mean that some functions you need are not available. Look at `src/hb-config.hh` in the Harfbuzz source directory to see what has been removed. For example, `HB_TINY` defines `HB_LEAN` which (amongst other things) defines `HB_NO_OT_GLYPH_NAMES`. If, for example, you really need to get at the glyph names:

1. First, undefine the macro in question, by adding e.g. `#undef HB_NO_OT_GLYPH_NAMES` to `config-override.h`.
2. Next, export any function that you need by adding a line to `hbjs.symbols`; in this case `_hb_ot_get_glyph_name`.
3. Now the function will be exported through the WASM object, but you need to add Javascript to bridge to it - in this case, handling the memory allocation of the `char *` parameter `name` and marshalling it to a JavaScript string with `heapu8.subarray`. The best way to do this is to look at `hbjs.js` for functions which use similar signatures.

If you have extended harfbuzzjs in ways that you think others will also benefit from, please raise a pull request. If there are parts of Harfbuzz that you need but the instructions above don't work, describe what you are trying to do in an issue.

## Using the library in a bigger emscripten project?
See [harfbuzz port inside emscripten](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/blob/master/tools/ports/harfbuzz.py)
and [emscripten-ports/HarfBuzz](https://github.com/emscripten-ports/HarfBuzz), basically all you need is to use
`-s USE_HARFBUZZ=1` in your build.

## binaryen

Optionally you can install `binaryen` and use `wasm-opt` like:

```
wasm-opt -Oz hb.wasm -o hb.wasm
```

`binaryen` also provides `wasm-dis` which can be used for,

```
wasm-dis hb.wasm | grep export
wasm-dis hb.wasm | grep import
```

with that you can check if the built wasm file only exports things you need and
doesn't need to import anything, as usual with wasm files built here.
